🚨 PROJECT ALERT: EMAIL_PHISHING_ANALYSIS🚨

Welcome to my mini-project on Email Phishing Analysis! 🛡️ As phishing remains one of the top cyber threats, it's crucial to understand how these attacks work and how we can defend against them!

📧 What’s Phishing? 🎣
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers disguise themselves as trusted entities to steal sensitive information or spread malware through emails. Understanding and analyzing these emails is key to protecting ourselves!

🔍 Key Project Highlights:
 ⚠️Suspicious Attachments & Content: Always check for unusual attachments or overly urgent language in emails.

🔗 URL Analysis: Tools like Symantec Site Review and URLscan.io help identify whether a link is safe or harmful. 

🕵️ Email Header Inspection: Analyzing SPF status 🛑 and comparing "From" and "Return-Path" addresses can reveal important clues about phishing attempts.

🛡️ Bitdefender for Protection: Bitdefender’s real-time email protection ensures phishing emails don’t even make it to your inbox! 

🔧 Tools Used:

  🛠️ Symantec Site Review 
  🌐 URLscan.io 
  🖥️ Bitdefender 
  
This project has deepened my understanding of email security and the proactive measures we can take to guard against phishing attacks. Let’s stay cyber-safe, everyone! 💪
